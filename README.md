# Personal Meta-tap
## contains homebrew taps managed as git subtrees
----

## How do I install these formulae?
`brew install tmaone/brew/<formula>`

Or `brew tap tmaone/brew` and then `brew install <formula>`.

Or install via URL (which will not receive updates):

```
brew install https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tmaone/homebrew-brew/master/Formula/<formula>.rb
```
Do not forget to pin the tap so as to prioritize these formulae before core ones.

```
brew tap-pin tmaone/brew
```

## Documentation
`brew help`, `man brew` or check [Homebrew's documentation](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/tree/master/docs#readme).
